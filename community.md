The RobotPy project was started in 2010, and since then the community surrounding RobotPy has continued to grow!

If you need support, you can find it in the following locations

* [RobotPy mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robotpy)
* [ChiefDelphi Python Forums](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=187)

Release Announcements
---------------------

During the build season, we post release announcements to the
[ChiefDelphi Python forum](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=187) and
to the RobotPy mailing list, particularly if critical bugs are fixed.

If you're on a team that uses RobotPy, we highly recommend subscribing to our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robotpy).

Chat
----

During the FRC Build Season, some RobotPy developers may be able to be reached on
the [RobotPy Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib).  _Note: the channel is not very active, but if you stick around long enough someone will probably answer your question -- think in terms of email response time_
